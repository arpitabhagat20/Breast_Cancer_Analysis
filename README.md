# Breast_Cancer_Analysis
# Overview
This project focuses on the analysis of breast cancer data to identify key patterns and insights that could help in the early detection and treatment of breast cancer. The dataset used in this project includes various attributes related to breast cancer cases, which will be explored and analyzed using different data science techniques.

# Dataset Description

texture_mean: Mean texture of the tumor
perimeter_mean: Mean perimeter of the tumor
area_mean: Mean area of the tumor
smoothness_mean: Mean smoothness of the tumor
compactness_mean: Mean compactness of the tumor
concavity_mean: Mean concavity of the tumor
concave_points_mean: Mean number of concave points on the tumor
symmetry_mean: Mean symmetry of the tumor
fractal_dimension_mean: Mean fractal dimension of the tumor
radius_se: Standard error of the radius
texture_se: Standard error of the texture
perimeter_se: Standard error of the perimeter
area_se: Standard error of the area
smoothness_se: Standard error of the smoothness
compactness_se: Standard error of the compactness
concavity_se: Standard error of the concavity
concave_points_se: Standard error of the concave points
symmetry_se: Standard error of the symmetry
fractal_dimension_se: Standard error of the fractal dimension

Project Structure
The project is organized into the following sections:

# Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, correcting data types, and removing duplicates.
# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing the distribution of features, identifying correlations, and understanding the relationship between features and the target variable (diagnosis).
# Feature Engineering: Creating new features, normalizing data, and selecting important features for model building.
# Model Building: Developing machine learning models to predict breast cancer diagnosis.
# Model Evaluation: Evaluating the performance of the models using appropriate metrics.
# Conclusion: Summarizing findings and providing recommendations.

# Setup and Installation
To run the analysis, you need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:

pandas

numpy

matplotlib

seaborn

scikit-learn

You can install these libraries using pip:

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn

# Usage
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Navigate to the project directory.
Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script containing the analysis.

# Conclusion
This project aims to provide insights into breast cancer data that can aid in early detection and treatment. By leveraging data analysis and machine learning techniques, we hope to contribute to the ongoing efforts in the medical field to combat breast cancer.
